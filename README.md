# Tech Share

  ## Description 

  This project, which follows the MVC paradigm, is a blog site where users share information about technology.
  A user can sign up or log in and after doing either, can comment on existing posts as well as create, edit, or delete thier own posts.
  Idle users will be logged out after 90 seconds without a click, so be quick!
